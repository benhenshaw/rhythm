# Getting Started (2017/09/30)
I want to build rhythm game for my final year project.

## Design
My favourite in the genre is Rhythm Tengoku (2006, GBA), which is mini-game based with a comedic theme. This game is single-player, with each mini-game requiring the player to demonstrate some ability to stay in time with music, but each having its own take on what the player should be doing. The game does not use many buttons for this as it is not about reflexes and hyper-awareness so much as a raw sense of rhythm and use of logic.

Dance Dance Revolution (PS, 1998) and Guitar Hero (PS2, 2005) are also rhythm games, but their focus (and theme) are very different. Both are score focused, with competitive elements, where the player has a higher score the more beats they hit successfully, and the player with the highest score wins. These games are also more reflex based, with an emphasis on memorising the patterns of button presses mapped to a song. I find this less interesting, and can be alienating to those who may not have the physical capacity to play them, or the time to memorise songs. This is not the kind of game I would like to make, but I do like the competitive nature of them.

I would like to borrow the aspects of these games that I like for my project, and include new features that the genre has not seen yet.
